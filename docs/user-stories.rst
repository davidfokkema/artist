User Stories
============

These are user stories.

    * Alice has some data and wishes to plot it and put the plot in a LaTeX
      document.  It has to look *beautiful*

    * Bob has made some plots using ``matplotlib`` and now wants to easily
      finalize them using *artist*

    * Alice wants to make the usual plots: scatter (point) plots, line plots,
      line plots with points

    * Bob wants to plot a histogram.  *Not* with bars!  He wants a stepped plot.

    * Alice wants to plot multiple distributions using a box plot.

    * Bob wants to make a contour plot.

    * Alice wants to add horizontal and vertical lines to her plot, to show some
      specific limits, for example.

    * Of course, Bob is not satisfied until all fonts look exactly the same as in
      the rest of his LaTeX document, including equations.

    * Alice wants to add annotations to the plot, like labels.  If all else
      fails, she wants to add a legend, outside of the axes.

    * Bob wants to have a matplotlib backend to easily prototype plots and
      then generate the final plot by selecting the TikZ backend.  Also, Bob
      wants to quickly generate plot output and view it.

    * Alice wants to make a scatterplot matrix by simply providing *n* sets of
      quantities and their descriptions.
